# Log Extraction Solution

## Solutions Considered
1. **Naive Approach**: Reading entire file into memory
   - Pros: Simple implementation
   - Cons: Extremely memory-intensive for 1 TB file
   - Not suitable for large log files

2. **Generator-based Approach** (Chosen Solution)
   - Uses memory-efficient generators
   - Streams file line by line
   - Minimal memory footprint
   - O(n) time complexity

## Final Solution Summary
- Uses Python's file reading generators
- Stream processes log file
- Writes matching logs to output file
- Handles large files efficiently

## Steps to Run
1. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed
2. Place script in project directory
3. Run with command:
   ```
   python extract_logs.py test_logs.log 2024-12-01
   ```

## Performance Optimization
- Single-pass file reading
- Minimal memory allocation
- Constant memory usage regardless of file size
